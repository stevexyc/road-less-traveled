You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

what is this? is this a <b>powerful engine</b> so this is definitely a <i>template?</i>

<div class="blue" style="background-color:#f7f7f7;padding:10px 20px;">
	<img src="http://placekitten.com/300/200"/>
	<h2>test</h2>
</div>

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
